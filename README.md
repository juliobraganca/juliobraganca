# Hi there, I'm JÃºlio ðŸ‘‹

- :man_student: I am a former finance manager that is diving into the technology world.
- I am mainly learning iOS native development (Swift) at the moment because I want to focus in Mobile Development.
- I am studying full time at the moment so I am eager to join projects and specially a company where I can grow further.
